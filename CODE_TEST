"""
GIS Data Validation Script
===========================
Objective:
- Check geometric and topological rules for urban inventory data.
- Identify errors in spatial relationships (overlaps, intersections, topology).
- Generate a report with non-compliant features.

Input Data:
- roads.gpkg : Contains road geometries (streets, bike lanes).
- pedestrian_crossings.gpkg : Contains pedestrian crossing geometries.
- green_spaces.gpkg : Contains green space geometries.
- urban_mobility.gpkg : Contains urban furniture geometries.
- infrastructure.gpkg : Contains network infrastructure geometries.

Output:
- errors_report.gpkg : Stores non-compliant geometries for correction.
"""

# 1) Import necessary libraries


# 2) Load GIS data


# 3) Validate road geometries
## - Check for self-intersections
## - Check for duplicate geometries
## - Ensure roads are properly connected


# 4) Validate pedestrian crossings
## - Ensure crossings intersect roads or bike lanes
## - Ensure at least two sides are connected to a road


# 5) Validate vegetation data
## - Ensure trees are inside green spaces
## - Ensure trees are at least 1m apart


# 6) Validate urban furniture
## - Ensure objects are on a valid surface (not inside buildings or roads)
## - Ensure they are properly connected to urban elements


# 7) Validate network infrastructure
## - Ensure infrastructure elements intersect roads or green spaces
## - Validate spatial accuracy within the defined tolerance


# 8) Identify and export errors
## - Compile all detected issues
## - Export non-compliant geometries for correction


# 9) Display summary report
